# HAYAT Sphere™ – Modular Humanitarian Flood Survival Kit (Open-Source)

**Mission:** Design once, save many. A modular, buy-what-you-need kit that poor & vulnerable families can assemble locally.
**Ethos:** Zero profit • Recycled materials • Open-source hardware/software • Community fabrication

## Modules
- **Shell** (recycled plastic housing; sphere/dome)
- **Ballast** (mechanical water pockets; stable floor)
- **Power** (micro-hydro + solar + hand-crank, LiFePO₄ 12V)
- **Water** (intake → settle → cloth → slow sand → carbon → UF/Ceramic → UV → tank; optional RO)
- **Air/Oxygen** (natural vents; optional PSA O₂; CO₂ scrub)
- **Food/Storage** (7-day ration bins; solar dehydrator)
- **Connectivity** (LoRa mesh, GSM/SMS, GPS/SOS; offline AI guide)
- **Waste/Sanitation** (dry toilet, greywater diverter)

## Quick Start
1. Open **docs/** for system diagrams.
2. Start building with **modules/water/** and **modules/power/** (BOMs included).
3. Contribute CAD/PCB to **hardware/**, firmware to **firmware/**, and comms code to **comms/**.
4. Read **manufacturing/ASSEMBLY.md** for community build steps.
5. Publish your local variants and costs in **manufacturing/local-builds/**.

## Licences
- Hardware CAD/PCB: **CERN-OHL-S** (see `LICENSE-CERN-OHL-S.txt`)
- Firmware/Code: **MIT** (see `LICENSE-MIT.txt`)
- Documentation/Diagrams: **CC BY-SA 4.0** (see `LICENSE-CC-BY-SA-4.0.txt`)

## Safety Notice
- Treat all floodwater as contaminated. Use backflow preventers and sanitize housings.
- UV chamber must be opaque & sealed; never look at UV light.
- Size wires, fuses, and enclosures to your actual loads; consult a qualified technician for local compliance.
