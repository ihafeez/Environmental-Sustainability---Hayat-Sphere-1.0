# Assembly Guide (Fast Track)

## Bill of Materials
See `modules/water/` and `modules/power/` for detailed BOMs.

## Tools Needed
- Hand saw/PVC cutter, drill, crimp tool, multimeter, silicone sealant, teflon tape.
- Safety: gloves, goggles, masks.

## Water Module Steps
1) Intake screen → connect to settling bucket.
2) Build slow sand column (gravel bottom, then sand; rinse until clear).
3) Add activated carbon cartridge in a separate housing.
4) Install UF/Ceramic inline filter.
5) Mount UV chamber (opaque tube), wire to 12V supply via fuse.
6) Route to potable tank with check valve; add vent & level tube.
7) Test for leaks; flush first 10–15 L.

## Power Module Steps
1) Mount micro-hydro in flow channel or hose; wire rectifier → DC/DC.
2) Mount solar strips/panels; connect to MPPT.
3) Install LiFePO₄ battery with BMS in IP65 box; add fuses/breakers.
4) Add 12→5 V buck for electronics; 12→24 V boost only if RO is used.
5) Verify polarity, grounds, and cable sizing; log volts/amps during test.

## Commissioning
- Sanitize water path; measure turbidity/TDS; verify UV current draw.
- Load test power system with pumps + lights; record runtime.
- Label all valves/switches; store spares (filters, fuses).

## Local Fabrication Notes
- Recycle HDPE/PET for shell; heat-press into panels; solvent weld or bolt with gaskets.
- Keep electronics in upper dry zone with drip loops on all cables.
